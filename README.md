This repository contains a collection of web applications I built using Django for the backend, showcasing my experience in developing dynamic and functional websites. Each project demonstrates a strong backend foundation paired with responsive and interactive front-end designs using advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I deployed it into the network using pythonanywhere.com, so you can access it via https://dls2019.pythonanywhere.com/
